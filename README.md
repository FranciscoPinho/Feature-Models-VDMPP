#Feature Models

A formal modelling project, objective is to build a meta model to incrementally build feature models, validate configurations and generate all possible valid configurations of a feature model. This is done by first creating a VDM++ model and then automatically generating Java Code with Overture.
A simple GUI was also developed to interact with the model.
